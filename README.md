# Biomaterials and Medical Device Mechanisms  
Engineering notes from MSE1040 (University of Toronto)

This repository summarizes core concepts in biomaterials, material–tissue interactions, 
and failure/selection mechanisms for medical devices. These notes are curated from 
my graduate coursework in MSE1040 and reflect my understanding of how materials 
behave in biological environments and how these behaviors influence device design.

## Topics Covered
- Protein adsorption & surface interactions (hydrophobicity, charge, Vroman effect)
- Blood compatibility, thrombosis, and surface-driven biological responses
- Stents (316L, Co–Cr, NiTi, bioresorbable polymers): design, failure, degradation
- Catheters & cardiovascular devices: polymer selection and mechanical behavior
- Pyrolytic carbon heart valves: microstructure, wear, fatigue mechanisms
- Tissue engineering materials (hydrogels, scaffolds, skin substitutes)
- Mechanotransduction & cell–material interactions
- Design criteria for implantable devices
- In vitro vs. in vivo considerations and failure pathways
